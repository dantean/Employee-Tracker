## Credit Where Credit Is Due

- Thanks to instructor Phil Loy for going over this before and after class and answering my questions about it. 
- Additional special thanks to tutor Juno Nguyen for VERY thoroughly explaining what I was missing and helping me to write the javascript for the 'Add' functions. I literally couldn't have done it without you!
